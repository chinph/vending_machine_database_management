# Vending machine Database Management
## 1. Project Purpose
CUNY has a wide range of vending machines to provide its staff and students with various types of
snacks and beverages. In order to manage the machines effectively and bring employees and students
the best services, the school has decided to research and develop a database to keep track of all the
information relating to the machines.

## 2. Methodology
This report covers steps that describe how the final vending machine database management model was
developed. My project begins with a description of the CUNY vending machine Entity-Relationship
model. Then, based on the ER model, I will convert the ER model to a relational model and conduct the
normalization process. After the normalization, the ER model and relational models will be changed
accordingly. Lastly, by applying SQL, the database is created in MS Access to record all the information
for future control and analysis.
